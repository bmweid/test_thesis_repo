    <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Estimated posterior densities for effects of black-crowned night-heron (BCNH) nest density, double-crested cormorant (DCCO) nest density, DCCO growth index, road proximity, and active nest removal management on BCNH colony growth index in the Tommy Thompson Park, Toronto, Ontario. Vertical lines show the location of 0, the value indicating no effect. Note the variation in scale of the x-axis among plots. All numerical covariates were scaled to have a standard deviation of 1 prior to model fitting.
